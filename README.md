# Crop Yield Prediction Application

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on various input features such as crop type, season, state, area, production, and more. The application uses a trained Random Forest model to make predictions and is deployed using Streamlit, a framework for building interactive web applications in Python.

## Project Overview

### Features
- Predict crop yields for past and future years.
- Inputs include crop type, season, state, and time period.
- Utilizes a Random Forest model for predictions.
- Supports user input through a web-based interface.
