#Crop Yield Prediction Application
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on various input features such as crop type, season, state, area, production, and more. The application uses a trained Random Forest model to make predictions and is deployed using Streamlit, a framework for building interactive web applications in Python.

Project Overview
Features
Predict crop yields for past and future years.
Inputs include crop type, season, state, and time period.
Utilizes a Random Forest model for predictions.
Supports user input through a web-based interface.
Technology Stack
Python: Programming language for developing the model and application.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training the Random Forest model.
Streamlit: Framework for deploying the model as an interactive web application.
